OXID eShop: Restrict available payments by category or theme

This module deals with two situations:

1. Restrict payments by category: A shop owner might want to restrict payments for certain articles, 
for example some products can not be paid with Paypal due to Paypal terms and conditions. With this
module, a hidden category "nopaypal" can be created and payment via Paypal is not possible if an
article in basket belongs to this category.

2. Restrict payment by theme: If a shop owner installs the free mobile theme for Oxid eShop, he may
find that not all payment modules are ready to work in this theme. With this module those payments
can be excluded if a customer uses a mobile device and the mobile theme.
